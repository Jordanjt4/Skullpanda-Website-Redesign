I re-imagined the Skullpanda Website main page to practice designs. 

This is a passion project at most (I had an itch to design with reds and gradients!), but I learned about React components, responsive design, and is CSS heavy.

I also learned how complex the relationship between design and implementation is. Pretty elements and features don’t always translate well in coding. 

This project’s “complex” features are the parallax clouds that fade in upon scrolling and image carousels.
